# Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS)

Implemented MIPS monocycle in VHDL hardware description

## VHDL Sources
### What is already implemented

- ALU 32 Bits
- ALU Operations
- Bank of Registers
- Concatenator from 28 to 32
- Data Memory 
- Instruction Memory
- Multiplexer of 32 Bits
- Multiplexer of 5 Bits
- Program Counter
- Shift/Signal Extender of 2 Bits to left (26 to 28 bits)
- Signal Extender from 16 to 32 Bits
- SUM (for the PC+4)
- Frequency divider (Some parts of our MIPS needs to work in a different frequency)

- TOP LEVEL
- DATAPATH
- CONTROL
